The extension module is a publicly exposed service that acts as a middleware between the commercetools platform and Adyen. 
The extension module is called remotely from the commercetools platform with the [commercetools HTTP API Extensions](https://docs.commercetools.com/http-api-projects-api-extensions) 
before processing of a create or update request of a commercetools payment.
