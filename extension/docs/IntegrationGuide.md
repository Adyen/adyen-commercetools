## Glossary
In this process, there are 3 parties involved:

- **Shop** - the application that the shopper interacts with. It contains of a frontend part and a backend part.  
- **Extension module** - hosted service (this repository) that interacts over [API extensions](https://docs.commercetools.com/http-api-projects-api-extensions).  
- **Shopper** - a person that's using the shop

## Requirements for CTP project
All the requirements below are automatically created by the Extension module.
1. [API Extension subscription to Extension module endpoints](../resources/api-extension.json)
1. [Custom types for payments](../resources/payment-custom-types.json)
1. [Custom types for interface interactions](../resources/payment-interface-interaction-types.json)

**Note**: Extension module will not create if there are already resources with same key in the CTP project. In this case, you have to synchronize by yourself.

## Required parameters
In order to make the extension module working, following parameters have to be provided to the Extension module.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `CTP_PROJECT_KEY` | CTP credentials of the shop project. Go to `https://mc.commercetools.com/${your-ctp-project}/settings/developer/api-clients`. This module needs to CRUD multiple CTP resources, thus recommended template is `Admin Client`. |
| `CTP_CLIENT_ID` | CTP credentials of the shop project. Go to `https://mc.commercetools.com/${your-ctp-project}/settings/developer/api-clients`. This module needs to CRUD multiple CTP resources, thus recommended template is `Admin Client`. |
| `CTP_CLIENT_SECRET` | CTP credentials of the shop project. Go to `https://mc.commercetools.com/${your-ctp-project}/settings/developer/api-clients`. This module needs to CRUD multiple CTP resources, thus recommended template is `Admin Client`. |
| `API_EXTENSION_BASE_URL` | URL of the Extension module. This URL will be called by CTP Extension endpoint. |
| `ADYEN_API_KEY` | Go to [Account/Users](https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/config/users.shtml) - Select a user with `Web Service` User type - Generate New API Key (notice: in case you get `403 Forbidden` error from Adyen, try to regenerate the key). |
| `ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT` | Go to [Account/Merchant accounts](https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/accounts/show.shtml?accountTypeCode=MerchantAccount) and get the name in Acccount code. | |
| `KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT` | milliseconds to keep a socket alive after the last response ([Node.js docs](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/http.html#http_server_keepalivetimeout)) |

# Checkout steps
In your shop, ensure the steps below are done:
1. On each checkout step [validate cart state](#validate-cart-state)
1. Before starting payment process make sure there is no valid payments already:
    * [Recalculate cart](#recalculate-cart)
    * [Validate payment](#validate-payment)
    * [Validate payment transaction](#validate-payment-transaction)

If all above validations are passed then order can be created right away and order confirmation page shown.
Otherwise shopper might continue with further payment steps.

1. **Get available payment methods**  
    1. [Create/update a CTP Payment](https://docs.commercetools.com/http-api-projects-payments) with following properties:
        - `Payment.paymentMethodInfo.method = empty or undefined`   
        - `Payment.custom.fields.countryCode != null` - set the country of a shopper. Please [consult with Adyen](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/PaymentSetupAndVerificationService/v41/paymentMethods) for the right format.  
    1. Extension module will make a [request](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/checkout/api-integration#step1getavailablepaymentmethods) to Adyen API and the response will be saved in interface interaction with `type='ctp-adyen-integration-interaction'` and `fields.type='getAvailablePaymentMethods'` as stringified JSON.
    1. Before presenting the payment methods in the response from Adyen, please check Extension module documentation for supported payment methods.
1. **Continue with one of the supported payment methods**
    - [Credit card payment](./CreditCardIntegration.md)  
    - [Paypal payment](./PaypalIntegration.md)

# Error cases
1. **Adyen returns HTTP code other than 200**  
Request and response from Adyen are always stored in `Payment.interfaceInteractions` as strigified JSON.
1. **Shopper successfully paid but `redirectUrl` was not reached**  
In some payment redirect cases there might be a valid payment but no order as shopper did not reach the shop's `redirectUrl`.
For example after successfully issued payment shopper loses internet connection or accidentally closes the tab.
In this case [Notification module](../../notification) will receive later a notification with successful content, process it and update the payment.
Usage of scheduled [commercetools-payment-to-order-processor](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-payment-to-order-processor) job ensures that for every successful payment
an order can still be asynchronously created.
1. **Shopper tries to pay different amount than the actual order amount**   
For redirect payments payment amount is bound to `redirectUrl`.
After redirect and before actual finalisation of the payment at provider's page, shopper is still able to change the cart's amount within the second tab.
If shopper decides to change cart's amount within the second tab and finalise payment within the first tab, then according to payment amount validation an error
will be shown and order creation declined.

# Validations
### Validate cart state
Check if [current cart has been ordered already](https://docs.commercetools.com/http-api-projects-carts#cartstate) (`Cart.cartState = Ordered`).
In this case load order by ordered cart ID and show order confirmation page.
This might happen if cart has been already ordered in a different tab 
or by asynchronous process like [commercetools-payment-to-order-processor job](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-payment-to-order-processor).

### Recalculate cart
[Execute cart recalculate](https://docs.commercetools.com/http-api-projects-carts#recalculate) to ensure:
 - Cart totals are always up-to-date 
 - Time limited discounts are not removed/invalidated from cart automatically. They are validated on recalculate and order creation only.

### Validate payment
There must be at least one CTP payment object of type Adyen
(`Payment.paymentMethodInfo.paymentInterface = ctp-adyen-integration`)
AND this CTP payment must have `Payment.interfaceId`.

### Validate payment transaction
Cart's payment counts as successful if there is at least one payment object
with only successful (`Payment.Transaction.state=Success`)
payment transactions of type `Charge`.

### Mapping from Adyen result codes to CTP transaction state
|Adyen result code| CTP transaction state
| --- | --- |
| redirectshopper| Pending|
| received| Pending|
| pending| Pending|
| authorised| Success|
| refused| Failure|
| cancelled| Failure|
| error| Failure|

# Bad practice
- Never delete or un-assign created payment objects during checkout from the cart. If required â€” clean up unused/obsolete payment objects by another asynchronous process instead.
