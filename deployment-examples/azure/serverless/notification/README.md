## Deploy as Azure function app

1. In order to setup the notification module config, follow our [how to run guide](../../../../notification/docs/HowToRun.md).
2. Extension module requires `ADYEN_INTEGRATION_CONFIG` as `environment variable`.
3. Deployments work by uploading an archive containing your function's source code and their dependencies. 
You could use a deployment package to deploy your function code to Azure function app.
To bundle the notification module, navigate into `notification` folder and run `npm run zip-azure-function`. 
4. To change the configuration of notification function, please check [function.json](../../../../extension/extension-trigger/function.json) and [host.json](../../../../extension/host.json).
   By default, the Functions runtime looks for your function in index.js.
    > In the default case, your exported function should be the only export from its file or the export named run or index.
5. Please check our [FAQ](../../../../docs/FAQ.md) for your deployment.
