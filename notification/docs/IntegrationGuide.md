Notification module is a publicly exposed service which receives asynchronous notifications sent by Adyen,
Through notifications, Adyen provides asynchronously payment status changes like authorization, charge, or refund of the payment.
The notification module will process the notification and update the matching commercetools payment accordingly.

The following diagram shows the integration flow of the notification module based on [Adyen Notification webhooks](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks).

## Step 1: Set up notification webhook and generate HMAC signature

You have to register the Notification module `public URL` in the Adyen Customer Area in order to receive notifications.
To protect your server from unauthorized notifications, we strongly recommend that you activate Hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) signatures during the setup.

Please follow the [instructions](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks#set-up-notifications-in-your-customer-area) described by Adyen to set up notifications in your live Customer Area.

> Note: HMAC verification is enabled by default. You could use "ADYEN_ENABLE_HMAC_SIGNATURE=false" environment variable to disable the verification feature.

## Step 2: Deploy the notification module

In order to make the extension module up and running, follow our [how to run guide](./HowToRun.md).

## Step 3: Processing notifications

Adyen sends notifications which look like this:

```json
{
  "live": "false",
  "notificationItems": [
    {
      "NotificationRequestItem": {
        "additionalData": {
          "hmacSignature": "cjiTz03EI0jkkysGDdPJQdLbecRVVU/5jm12/DTFEHo="
        },
        "amount": {
          "currency": "EUR",
          "value": 10100
        },
        "eventCode": "AUTHORISATION",
        "eventDate": "2019-01-30T18:16:22+01:00",
        "merchantAccountCode": "YOUR_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT",
        "merchantReference": "YOUR_REFERENCE", // should match an existing payment key in commercetools
        "operations": ["CANCEL", "CAPTURE", "REFUND"],
        "paymentMethod": "visa",
        "pspReference": "test_AUTHORISATION_1", // should match a transaction interactionId in commercetools
        "success": "true"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Each notification contains an `eventCode` that specifies which type of event triggered the notification.
Notification module maps this `eventCode` and `success` pair to
commercetools [transactionType](https://docs.commercetools.com/http-api-projects-payments#transactiontype)
and [transactionState](https://docs.commercetools.com/http-api-projects-payments#transactionstate).

> All mappings can be found in the [adyen-events.json](./../resources/adyen-events.json) file.

After finding a mapping the notification module will find a matching payment on a commercetools project.
To find the matching payment, `merchantReference` field from the notification is used to find a payment by key
and `pspReference` field from the notification is used to find a transaction by its interactionId.

If there is no transaction on the payment found,
the notification module will create a new transaction with the received `transactionType` and
`transactionState`. Otherwise, it will update the existing transaction with a new `transactionState`.

Received notification will be stored on the [interfaceInteraction](https://docs.commercetools.com/http-api-projects-payments#add-interfaceinteraction) of the payment.
If the mapping for the received notification is not found then payment will be updated only with a new `interfaceInteraction`.
If payment is not found then the notification will be skipped from processing.

## Test and go live

Before you go live please follow the official Adyen [go-live checklist](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks#test-and-go-live).

## FAQ

Can I remove a subscription I created?

- If you accidentally created a subscription you can edit it and uncheck the **Active** checkbox so Adyen doesn't
  send notifications. Then you can contact the Adyen support and ask them to remove the subscription

How does the notification module find a matching payment?

- It first find the payment by `key` where `key=${merchantReference}` and then it finds in this payment the corresponding transaction
  by `interactionId` where `interactionId=${pspReference}`.

Will we lose a notification if it was not processed for some reason?

- Adyen will queue notifications when the notification service was not reachable or it didn't return a success message and will try to send it later.
